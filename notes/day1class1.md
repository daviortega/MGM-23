  - challenging subjects in Euks (plants and etc.)

Euks genomes do not assemble well from metagenomics.

IMG does not have a lot of data about gene structure.

JGI has a plant program that does not interact with the metagenomics people.

IMG has some data.

If you are interested in mice and humans are even harder challenges. Microbiomes are fine, but not the genome it self.
