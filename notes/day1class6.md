# Introduction to IMG
*by Nikos Kyrpides*

IMG - Integrated Microbial Genome

Annotation in IMG is dynamic.



MG-RAST and IMG/M

half billion proteins without any hits to isolates.
200k clusters with more than 100 members
1/4 are from virus. Complicated way to know if they are from viruses or not.


Questions:

1) RefSeq equivalent = NO
2) Pfam and COG coverage... based on reads (single hit, length of match)
