# Introduction to the JGI
*by Axel Visel*

Axel is the acting director of the JGI.

## What is JGI

JGI was one of the centers that was involved in the human genome.

Since then, JGI has a mission towards the department of Energy

DOE funds fundamental sciences via user facilities

## JGI as a user facility

Mission: *To advance energy and environmental science by providing access to state-of-the-art genomics capabilities.*


JGI Science programs:
  - metagenmics
  - plants
  - fungi
  - microbes
  - DNA Synthesis Science

JGI capabilities
  - DNA sequencings...


### Strategic directions

**Vision** : *Evolve from a production sequencing center to a Next-Generation Genome Science User Facility*

[strategic plan](jgi.doe.gov])

## Capabilities

1. Sequencing capabilities
  - Interested in microbiomes
  - yearly produced 135.9 Tbases (Illumina)
  - PacBio ---
  - Multiple platforms
    - MISEQ, HISEQ, PacBio

### PacBio plataform

> higher error rate,  longer reads


Illumina vs. PacBio: 8191 contigs vs. 232 contigs.

Same cost (PacBio is more expensive per base pair but you need less)

### Nanopore sequencing.

Does not require polymerase or amplification
Needs as long DNA as possible.

Accuracy is bad and technology is not robust enough to be release as a product. Yet.

## Diversity surveys: iTags

## Single cell genomes

Single cell genome pipeline:
- sampling
- cell sorting
- genome amplification
- cell identification
- sequencing
- data qc
- ...

## DNA Synthesis

Interest in writing DNA

## Metabolomics

Integration of genomics and biochemistry
-> Biochemical universe

## Computational Technologies

## User opportunities

Apply for data generation - peer reviewed
1/3 of them is "funded"

150 new projects initiated

Annual call:
- Announced in January
- Letters of intent due tin early April.
- Proposals due early June
- review in July/August
- start October

Review criteria:
- Scientific merit
- DOE relevance

Other calls:
- small-scale metagenomics & single cell Call
  - used to generate preliminary data.
- FICUS - JGI-EMSL calls
  - Genomics + analytical capabilities (Mass spec)

JGI - Annual Meeting: useful to meet other JGI people.

JGI is moving to LBL (2019)
