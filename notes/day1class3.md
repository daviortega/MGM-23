 ### Goals
  - streamlining processes from sample in to sequence out.

### Pipeline:
- Quality control
- Library preparation
- Sequencing PacBio/Illumina

JGI is all automated

Automated library creation

more than 24,000 unique sequencing libraries last year.

DNA - WGS
Transcriptome: RNA / RNA-Seq


Illumina sample preparation

fragment DNA,


How illumina works

Illumina's new project: Project firefly

Fast and cheaper


### Itags

- target 16S rRNA v4-v5 region  



## PacBio

avg. 13 kb

1 day prep 2-6hr/cell movie time, 16 cells in quere.

Sequel system - 2015
JGI, Mount Sinai, Roche

50% cost reduction

## Why gaps !?

GC content correlates with read covergae in Illumina. PacBio is immune to low GC contents.

## Oxford Nanopore
JGI is benchmarking
high error rate and not high throughput

## Q&A

Error rates:
Illumina: 99.99% accuracy
PacBio: 15% error rate
  - typically 60x to 100x for microbes
  - 100x for fungi

Metagenomics needs high coverage. PacBio is not that useful.

Nanopore read lenghts... linear with the size of the template generated... up to 120kb
16% error rate
